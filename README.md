Pasdigi offers an open license repository for its clients. All licenses within this repository are completely open and accessible to anyone. This means every Pasdigi member can utilize them without exception.

Pasdigi guarantees license transparency. All software licenses are centrally managed on our servers, which means clients get automatic verification without needing to host the license themselves. The main benefit of this system is that clients only need to activate their license once and can then run the software seamlessly. Furthermore, software owners can protect their work from piracy without having to manage the license themselves.

Key Advantages
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Access:</strong> Because the repository is open, members can easily find and use the licenses they need, speeding up development and deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> The centralized system removes the need for clients and software owners to invest in their own license management infrastructure, saving time and money.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Reliability:</strong> Centralized verification ensures that licenses are authentic and that the system is secure and reliable. This minimizes the risk of fraudulent licenses or system failures.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Management:</strong> Software owners don't have to worry about the complexities of managing individual licenses, allowing them to focus on what they do best: creating great software.</li>
<li><strong>Community Trust:</strong> The open and transparent nature of the repository builds trust within the Pasdigi community, encouraging collaboration and fair use of software.</li>
</ul>
